1. What benefits does unit testing provide over testing a program as a whole?

2. Your MPs have been graded by autograders. Do the autograders perform black
   box testing or white box testing? Explain your answer.

3. Describe at least one pessimistic test case for programming problem 2 on
   midterm 2 day 1 (rawFloat multiplication).

4.     float result = my_sin(360.0);
       assert(result == 0.0);

   The assert in the above code snippet is too strict. Assume the
   specification allows my_sin to be off by at most 0.01. How should the
   assert statement be modified to reflect this? (Hint: You may use the fabs()
   absolute value function.)
