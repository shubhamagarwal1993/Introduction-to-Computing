1. What benefits does unit testing provide over testing a program as a whole?
Ans:	Unit testing has the following advantages:
		1.)capability of finding exactly where the mistake might be.
		2.)We can write just a couple of functions and test if we might doing the right thing.
		3.)while compiling we know exatly where the mistake in the function might be, whereas if we write the 				function and then compile, the actual mistake might end up to be at a completely different place 				than expecetd.

2. Your MPs have been graded by autograders. Do the autograders perform black
   box testing or white box testing? Explain your answer.
Ans:    The autograders perform black box testing because:
		1.)The autograder uses various inputs to check the output of our code against the 				correct answers.
		2.)In the grade file, we can see the various inputs used and the marks we have 				received for each of those inputs.

3. Describe at least one pessimistic test case for programming problem 2 on
   midterm 2 day 1 (rawFloat multiplication).
Ans: The following can be some of the pessimistic cases
		1.)the inputs are not rawFloat structures.
		2.)

4.     float result = my_sin(360.0);
       assert(result <= 0.01 && result => 0.01);

   The assert in the above code snippet is too strict. Assume the
   specification allows my_sin to be off by at most 0.01. How should the
   assert statement be modified to reflect this? (Hint: You may use the fabs()
   absolute value function.)
