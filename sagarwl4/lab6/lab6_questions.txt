Answer the following questions

1) What is the major fault with the following code? It is more intuitive to answer it without assembling it.
The major fault is the use of R7. 
So, everytime we use a subroutine, the lc3 uses the principal of storing the imcremented PC and use that when the TRAPx23 subroutine is complete.  



    .ORIG x3000
    LEA R3, BINARY      
    LD  R6, ASCII       ;character
    LD  R7, COUNT       ;initialize count to 10
REPEAT   TRAP x23       ;get character
    ADD R0,R0,R6        ;convert to a number
    STR R0,R3,#0        ;store number
    ADD R3,R3,#1        ;pointer is incremented
    ADD R7,R7,#-1       ;counter is decremented
    BRp REPEAT          ;carry on
    HALT
ASCII   .FILL   xFFD0
COUNT   .FILL   #10
BINARY  .BLKW   #10
    .END



2) Explain the difference between JSR and the JSRR instructions.

JSR puts the address of the next instruction into R7 and jumps to the label.

JSRR puts the address of the next insruction into R7 and and jumps to the address contained in the Register.
